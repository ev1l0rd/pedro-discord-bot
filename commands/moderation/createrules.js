1. Don't be a jerk. Be kind to other people and help them out.
  - This rule is also talking about messing with Paul because of the unbanmii situation 

2. No piracy. Don't link to wares - this includes the key site and the angel tool.

3. No alts, at least without asking a moderator first.
  - In order to get activated, you'll need to say "!APPROVEWORD" in #approval

4. Don't spam. This falls under rule 1 but I want to be explicit.

5. Don't bring up drama. This falls under rule 1 but I want to be explicit.
  - This includes importing drama from other servers. Hash it out there or in DMs. 
  - This rule also prohibits questions like "will freeshop contain malware?" (BTW, the answer to that is that as long as it's open sourced, we can see all the changes to freeshop meaning that it's possible to check if a developer adds nasty stuff to it): 

6. NSFW is prohibited.

7. Don't ask for any roles.

8. The cache updates on Monday, Wednesday & Saturday. Don't ask if it has updated, or for an update. The cache maintainer has a life outside of Freeshop.

9. All decisions by staff are final and not up to public debate. If you have a concern, take it up privately or in #meta.

10. No slurs.
